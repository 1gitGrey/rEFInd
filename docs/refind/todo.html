<hr />

<p>This page is part of the documentation for the rEFInd boot manager. If a Web search has brought you here, you may want to start at the <a href="index.html">main page.</a></p>

<hr />

<p>rEFInd is far from perfect. It's based on rEFIt, which has a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=161917&atid=821764">list of active bugs</a> on its project page on Sourceforge. I have not studied this bug list in detail for rEFInd's first release, although I've probably fixed a few of those bugs because I encountered them myself. Other bugs I may never fix because I lack the necessary hardware for testing.</p>

<p>This page exists to document some of rEFInd's known bugs and limitations, as well as features I hope to add in the future. Some of the items on this list are things that you may be able to help with, so if you'd like to contribute, feel free to drop me a line!</p>

<p>The following list groups things that need to be done into broad categories. In some cases, there's some ambiguity about how an item might best be classified. Without further ado, then:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Tasks with which non-programmers can help:</b>

    <ul>

    <li>Testing! rEFIt was complex enough that changes such as the ones
	I've made have the potential to disrupt the program's operation in
	unexpected ways. Since the initial 0.2.0 release, I've continued to
	add features to rEFInd, and every new feature is another way for
	bugs to get into the program. I can only test on a handful of
	systems with a limited number of configurations. Therefore, if you
	try rEFInd and run into bugs, please report them to me!</li>

    <li>I have little talent with graphics manipulation programs, so
	rEFInd's boot logo, such as it is, is pretty weak. If you have
	artistic talent and would like to create a rEFInd logo, please feel
	free to send it to me. I won't make any final decision about
	changes until at least June 30 of 2012.</li>

    <li>rEFIt's original design, and hence rEFInd's design, enables easy
	theming by replacing icon files. If you'd like to design a new
	theme for rEFInd, feel free to submit it. I might or might not
	replace the icons it uses now (most of which come from the Oxygen
	Icons package), but I may provide links to themes on this Web site
	(or even host them on the project's Sourceforge page). For more
	information on designing themes for rEFInd, see the <a
	href="themes.html">Theming rEFInd</a> page.</li>

    </ul></li> <!-- Non-programmer help -->

<li><b>Improvements to existing features:</b>

    <ul>

    <li>The support for booting legacy (BIOS) OSes on UEFI-based PCs
	currently has a number of limitations. Most importantly, it works
	off of the list of boot devices stored in the computer's NVRAM. I'd
	prefer to have it scan disks and partitions, as the Mac's legacy
	boot support does. Also, the UEFI legacy boot code presents empty
	optical drives and uses generic icons rather than OS-specific
	icons.</li>

    <li>Currently, rEFInd can detect whether it's compiled for <i>x</i>86
	or <i>x</i>86-64 systems and displays this information in its
	"About" screen (<tt>AboutrEFInd()</tt> in <tt>main.c</tt>). I'd
	like to add detection for Itanium and ARM systems, but I have no
	way to test such changes.</li>

    <li>Although the ICNS file format used by rEFInd supports multiple
	image sizes, if a size that rEFInd needs isn't present in the file,
	rEFInd can't use the icon. The ability to scale images to the
	desired size would be useful.</li>

    <li>A way to set the color of the font would be useful for theming
        purposes.</li>

    <li>The program's font features could be greatly improved by enabling
	use of a standard font format, by enabling use of non-ASCII
	characters, and by enabling use of variable-width as well as
	monospace fonts.</li>

    <li>I would like to be able to specify the volume on which a boot
	loader resides using a partition GUID value, but extracting a GUID
	from the partition data is harder than extracting the volume's
	label or counting up the filesystem numbers.</li>

    <li>Currently, if a filesystem's label comes up empty, rEFInd
	substitutes the size, so you get displays like <tt>boot
	EFI\foo\bar.efi from 90 GiB volume</tt>. I'd like to add more
	checks to substitute the GPT <i>partition</i> label if the
	<i>filesystem</i> label comes up empty.</li>

    <li>The <tt>default_selection</tt> option in <tt>refind.conf</tt> could
	be improved by supporting a list of default options, so that if the
	first item isn't found, rEFInd will try to boot the second one in
	the list, and so on. This could be handy in case a driver fails to
	load, or to provide an override in case the user inserts a specific
	removable disk&mdash;by placing the removable disk's name first in
	the list, it will take precedence over the normal hard disk
	default.</li>

    <li>Along the lines of the previous item, the default_selection might
	be expanded to support some form of specification of disk types, as
	in a special entry for any optical disk or any external disk, no
	matter what its name is.</li>

    <li>It would be useful to be able to specify paths to boot loaders
	and/or initial RAM disks relative to the rEFInd directory (or the
	boot loader's directory, in the case of initrds).</li>

    </ul></li> <!-- Improvements -->

<li><b>Known bugs that need squashing:</b>

    <ul>

    <li>The <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/gb-hybrid-efi/">Gigabyte
	Hybrid EFI</a> has a bug that causes the allegedly case-insensitive
	<tt>StriCmp()</tt> function to perform a case-sensitive comparison.
	This causes any number of bugs in file matching. For instance:
	Changing the case of icon filename extensions (or various other
	parts of icon filenames) causes icons to be replaced by ugly
	"generic" ones; and rEFInd sometimes appears in its own menu (the
	firmware sometimes returns an all-caps version of the filename, but
	other times returns the filename with the correct case, causing a
	mismatch if the path includes lowercase elements). Some of these
	problems can be overcome by converting both strings to be compared
	to one case before doing the comparison, but others aren't so easy,
	since I think <tt>StriCmp()</tt> is being called internally to the
	EFI. In any event, it'd be nice to fix some of these problems.
	OTOH, this is a workaround for a bug on just one EFI
	implementation, and a dismal one at that, so I'm inclined to just
	let it go.</li>

    <li>The Shutdown option works correctly on Macs, but not on many UEFI-based
	PCs. On such systems, Shutdown reboots the computer. This should be
	fixed.</li>

    <li>The media-ejection feature (F12) should be extended to work on
	UEFI-based PCs and early Macs. At the moment, it relies on an
	Apple-specific EFI extension, and I know of no standard EFI way to
	do it.</li>

    <li>A couple of Mac users have reported that the brightness-adjustment
	features in Windows don't work when Windows is booted via rEFInd,
	but that these features do work when Windows is booted via the
	Mac's built-in boot manager. Unfortunately, I have no idea what
	causes this problem, I have no Windows installation on my one
	(elderly) Mac, and I have no way to debug it. Therefore, it's
	unlikely that I'll be able to fix this problem myself; but if you
	have the equipment and skill to do so, I'd be interested in
	receiving a patch.</li>

    <li>The re-scan feature occasionally produces odd results, such as
	ignoring new media or keeping old media that have been ejected.
	This should be investigated and fixed.</li>

    <li>The "scanning for new boot loaders" message that appears during the
	re-scan feature is primitive. Some sort of dynamic icon would be
	nice, but perhaps impractical, given the single-tasking nature of
	EFI.</li>

    <li>On my Mac Mini, launching a shell, returning, and performing a
	re-scan causes the system to be unable to launch the shell again. I
	have not observed this behavior on UEFI-based PCs. It seems to be
	caused by a truncated DevicePath to the shell, which includes the
	shell's pathname but not the device identifier.</li>

    <li>When specifying a volume by name in <tt>dont_scan_dirs</tt>,
	slashes are converted to backslashes in the specification but not
	in the actual volume name read from disk. Thus, you can't specify a
	volume by name if it includes a slash (as in <tt>Fedora
	/boot</tt>). Workarounds are to rename the volume to omit the slash
	and to use a filesystem number rather than a volume label.</li>

    <li>The code is in need of review to search for memory leaks and
	similar problems.</li>

    <li>If the user has a Linux software RAID 1 array, rEFInd will detect
	kernels or boot loaders in RAID 1 twice. This could be fixed by
	adding a check for duplicate filesystem UUIDs to the
	partition-scanning code.</li>

    </ul></li> <!-- Known bugs -->

<li><b>New features I'd like to add:</b>

    <ul>

    <li>EFI supports network boots. rEFInd doesn't, but it would be nice if
	it would.</li>

    <li>There's currently no way to create a manual boot stanza for a
	BIOS-booted OS. This isn't a big priority for me personally, but I
	can see how it could be for some people.</li>

    <li>I've received queries about rEFInd's ability to work with Apple's
	whole-disk encryption scheme that's new with OS X 10.7.
	Unfortunately, I lack the hardware to test this, but my
	understanding is that it will work correctly <i>if</i> rEFInd is
	installed in the ESP rather than on the Mac OS X root partition.
	See <a
	href="https://sourceforge.net/p/refind/discussion/general/thread/5c7d0195/">this
	forum thread</a> for more information.</li>

    <li>I'd like to find a way to enable users to enter customizations for
	boot options and then save them to the <tt>refind.conf</tt> file.
	One possible way to implement this would be to have manual boot
	stanzas override auto-detected boot loader definitions for the same
	boot loader file.</li>

    <li>I have thoughts about creating an EFI configuration tool and
	information utility&mdash;something to tell you about your hard
	disks, enable you to manage MOKs, adjust boot loader priority in
	the NVRAM, and so on. This would be useful in system maintenance
	and in recovering from boot problems.</li>

    <li>An installation tool for the EFI environment would be useful.
        A simple EFI shell script might work, but because this function
	requires access to the <tt>bcfg</tt> command, this would work
	only from a version 2 shell or if <tt>bcfg</tt> were implemented
	as a standalone program. Another alternative would be a program
	written in C.</li>

    <li>It should be possible to override specific auto-detected boot
	loader settings&mdash;say, to disable one specific boot loader or
	change its icon.</li>

    <li>A GUI configuration tool would be nice, but it's low on my personal
	priority list. If you'd like to contribute, I prefer something
	written in a cross-platform GUI toolkit, so that a single code base
	can be used on any of the major OSes.</li>

    </ul></li> <!-- New features -->

<li><b>Improvements to the EFI drivers:</b>

    <ul>

    <li>Drivers for additional filesystems are desirable. Given the talk of
	shifting to Btrfs, that should be the priority; however, other
	Linux filesystems, UDF, and perhaps others would all be welcome
	additions. Also along these lines, adding drivers for Linux LVM and
	RAID setups would be useful, too.</li>

    <li>As detailed on the <a href="drivers.html">drivers page,</a> there
	are performance issues with the drivers on some systems. I suspect
	that most "real" computers aren't greatly affected (in my tests,
	the problem is worst with VirtualBox, and the next worst is a
	system that uses <a
	href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/bios2uefi/">DUET</a>). Nonetheless,
	I'd like to track down the cause and fix it.</li>

    <li>The HFS+ driver returns a volume label of "HFS+ volume", no matter
        what the volume's real label is.</li>

    <li>This may not be possible, or it may require a new driver, but a way
	to have the drivers access files (like a Linux loopback mount) is
	desirable.</li>

    <li>When built with the GNU-EFI package, an attempt to load more than
        one driver on my 32-bit Mac Mini causes the computer to hang. I do
	<i>not</i> have this problem with 64-bit drivers on my UEFI-based
	computers. I don't know if this is a 32-bit issue or a Mac issue.
	This is <i>not</i> relevant if you're using my binary package,
	since I build it with the TianoCore EDK2, and the drivers built in
	that way don't exhibit this bug.</li>

    </ul></li> <!-- Drivers -->
