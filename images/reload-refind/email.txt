E-mail from Erik Kemperman (erikkemperman@gmail.com):

hi,

First of all, I'd like to thank you profusely for making rEFInd, and the
excellent documentation, available!

I would gladly donate -- had I not just spent pretty much all of my hard
earned cash on this new MacBook Pro... I'm sure you hear that a lot.

Still, thanks in no small part to your efforts I am now happily dual
booting MacOS Mountain Lion and Linux Mint 14. There's really only one
glitch that I think you might want to know about; see below.

So, since I had read that you welcome suggestions for a logo, I decided to
have some fun with that. Please find attached the SVG file I came up with
(in InkScape) and three (rasterized at modest scale) variations I made (in
GIMP).

The idea -- although I will have failed if it's not immediately obvious --
was to combine the ubiquitous icons for "refresh/reload" and "find". I kept
them in grayscale so they should work against most backgrounds (banners).

Please feel free to do with these (or not) as you like, I hereby grant you
all rights. If you like the concept but not the execution, suggestions for
improvement would be welcome. Likewise, let me know if you'd like them in
different format / size.
